This is the first assignment in Exploring User Interaction, taught by Sydney Parks at UT Austin. 

It's a drum sequencer with a narrative element that draws a connection between developing a beat and my personal journey developing as a person.

Code used:
title: drum machine!
author: asd0999

reason: I used this as a jumping off point to build my drum sequencing system around. The code is pretty simple and doesn't have as much functionality as I'd like.
